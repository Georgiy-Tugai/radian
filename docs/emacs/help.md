# Getting help

Emacs offers extensive documentation. (This manual is only meant to be
a more concise guide to the exact features that likely to be most
useful.)

The following commands are useful to access this documentation.

In the help menus, you can navigate between clickable links with
`<tab>` and `<S-tab>`, and you can click on one either with the mouse
or by pressing `RET`.

You can page backward and forward through the various help pages you
have visited using `l` and `r`, respectively.
